Got it! You're now updating the portfolio design idea to this:

> ✅ First Page = Icon Dashboard (AI/ML concept icons)
✅ On Click = Navigate to a New Page
Each page should focus on a specific concept/section (e.g., Skills, Projects, Certificates).



Here’s your updated full prompt for RepKit or your developer:
